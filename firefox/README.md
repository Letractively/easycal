This is EasyCal, an appealing and easy-to-use calendar app as a Firefox addon
or a Chrome extension. You can install it at
[AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/easycal/).

EasyCal aims at erasing the pain when you use some other calendar
software. You need fewer clicks and typing to manage your schedule with
EasyCal.

You can select some texts from the web page and add it into your
schedule. Time and date information will be automatically recognized
and extracted.

The schedules are stored either in web browser's local storage (in
Chrome), or in the simple storage (by Firefox). In both cases the data
are persistent across browser restarts, and you don't need Internet
connection to access the stored schedules.

EasyCal struggles to be simple and smart. Hope you will like it.
