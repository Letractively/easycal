This is the project homepage of easycal, an appealing and easy-to-use
calendar app as an Chrome extension. You can install it right at
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jigbmbnnlofcabgibnakoocachndoifm Chrome Webstore].

Easycal aims at erasing the pain when you use some other calendar
software. You need fewer clicks and typing to manage your schedule with
easycal.

You can select some texts from the web page and add it into your
schedule. Time and date and location will be automatically recognized.

The schedule are stored in Chrome's local storage (nice HTML5 feature),
so you don't have to worry about loss of Internet connection.

Easycal struggles to be simple and smart. Hope you will like it.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcomed at the Issues
